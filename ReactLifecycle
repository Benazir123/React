React Lifecycle :
 
There are 3 phases in React lifecycle, they are:-
1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. UnMounting

Mounting :-> 
1. Constructor() ->  called before its mounted
2. getDerivedStateFromProps()  -> method called right before rendering the elements
3. render() -> instance of component created and inserted in the Dom (Only required in the class component)
4. ComponentDidMount() -> after a component is mounted

Updating :->
1. getDerivedStateFromProps() -> this is the first method to be called when component is updated
2. ShouldComponentUpdate() -> returns boolean method
3. render() -> after component re renders
4. getSnapShotBeforeUpdate() -> it shows previous state , previous props
5. ComponentDidUpdate() -> after updating occurs

UnMounting :->
1. ComponentWillUnmount() -> before a component is unmounted
